# QR Scanner Free Trial Fix - Summary

## Issue
The QR scanner module was showing all free trial bookings as active, regardless of when they were claimed. This was because the module wasn't checking if the free trial was still within the valid 7-day period.

## Solution
Updated the QR scanner to check if free trial bookings are still valid based on a 7-day limit, similar to the fix applied to the Plans component.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified QRScanner.jsx

#### Added:
- Imported `useCallback` hook
- Added `freeTrialStatus` state variable
- Created `isFreeTrialValid` function to check if a free trial booking is within the 7-day limit
- Updated all sections where `ticketInfo` is set to include free trial validity information
- Added display of free trial status in the ticket information section

#### Key Functions:
```javascript
const isFreeTrialValid = useCallback((bookingDate) => {
  if (!bookingDate) return false;
  
  let date;
  if (bookingDate.toDate && typeof bookingDate.toDate === 'function') {
      date = bookingDate.toDate();
  } else if (bookingDate instanceof Date) {
      date = bookingDate;
  } else {
      date = new Date(bookingDate);
  }
  
  // Check if booking is within the last 7 days
  const oneWeekAgo = new Date();
  oneWeekAgo.setDate(oneWeekAgo.getDate() - 7);
  
  return date > oneWeekAgo;
}, []);
```

### 2. Modified QRScanner.css

#### Added:
- CSS styles for free trial status display:
```css
.status.confirmed {
    background-color: rgba(72, 187, 120, 0.15);
    color: #68d391;
}

.status.used {
    background-color: rgba(220, 53, 69, 0.15);
    color: #fc8181;
}
```

## How It Works

1. When a ticket is scanned and verified, the system checks if it's a free trial booking
2. If it is a free trial booking, the system uses the `isFreeTrialValid` function to determine if the booking is still within the 7-day limit
3. The free trial status is displayed in the ticket information section:
   - "Active" (green) if the free trial is still valid
   - "Expired" (red) if the free trial is older than 7 days

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Scan a QR code for a free trial booking that was claimed within the last 7 days
   - Should show "Active" status
2. Scan a QR code for a free trial booking that was claimed more than 7 days ago
   - Should show "Expired" status
3. Scan a QR code for a regular (paid) booking
   - Should not show any free trial status

## Files Modified

1. `src/Components/admin/QRScanner.jsx` - Added free trial validity checking logic
2. `src/Components/admin/QRScanner.css` - Added CSS styles for status display

This fix ensures consistency with the Plans component's free trial eligibility checking and provides accurate information to admins scanning tickets.
