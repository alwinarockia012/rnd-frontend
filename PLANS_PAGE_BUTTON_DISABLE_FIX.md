# Plans Page Button Disable Fix - Summary

## Issue
The buttons showing "Booked for this week" or "Booked for a month" were not actually disabled - users could still click them even though they displayed booking status text.

## Solution
Updated the button disabled logic to properly disable buttons when a plan has been purchased, ensuring consistency between the visual state and functional state.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified Plans.jsx

#### Updated:
- Button disabled attribute logic to include purchased plan check
- Button className to include disabled styling when a plan has been purchased
- Ensured both visual and functional states are consistent

#### Key Changes:

1. **Updated Disabled Attribute Logic**:
   ```jsx
   // Before
   disabled={plan.freeTrial && !isEligibleForFreeTrial || (!plan.freeTrial && hasBookedThisWeek(plan.name))}
   
   // After
   disabled={plan.freeTrial && !isEligibleForFreeTrial || (!plan.freeTrial && (hasBookedThisWeek(plan.name) || purchasedPlan))}
   ```

2. **Updated ClassName Logic**:
   ```jsx
   // Before
   className={`cta-button ${plan.freeTrial ? 'free-trial' : ''} ${plan.popular ? 'popular-btn' : ''} ${plan.freeTrial && !isEligibleForFreeTrial ? 'disabled' : ''} ${!plan.freeTrial && hasBookedThisWeek(plan.name) ? 'disabled' : ''}`}
   
   // After
   className={`cta-button ${plan.freeTrial ? 'free-trial' : ''} ${plan.popular ? 'popular-btn' : ''} ${plan.freeTrial && !isEligibleForFreeTrial ? 'disabled' : ''} ${!plan.freeTrial && (hasBookedThisWeek(plan.name) || purchasedPlan) ? 'disabled' : ''}`}
   ```

## How It Works

1. When a user purchases any plan, the `purchasedPlan` state is set
2. All non-free trial plan buttons are now properly disabled when:
   - The user has already booked this week/month (existing logic)
   - A plan has been purchased (new logic)
3. The visual styling (orange color with disabled appearance) now matches the functional state (actually disabled)
4. Users cannot click on buttons showing "Booked for this week" or "Booked for a month"

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Select and purchase a plan
2. Verify that both payable cards show booking status and are actually disabled (cannot be clicked)
3. Try clicking on the disabled buttons to confirm they don't respond
4. Refresh the page and confirm the disabled state persists
5. Check that free trial buttons still work correctly based on eligibility

## Files Modified

1. `src/Components/Plans/Plans.jsx` - Updated button disable logic

This fix ensures that buttons showing booking status are properly disabled both visually and functionally, preventing users from attempting to purchase plans they've already bought.
