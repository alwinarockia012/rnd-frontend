## Key Configuration Changes

### Backend (Render)
- Uses PORT environment variable provided by Render
- Configured via render.yaml for easy deployment
- Environment variables for Razorpay keys must be set in Render dashboard

### Frontend (Netlify)
- Uses REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL to point to external backend
- Environment variables must be set in Netlify dashboard
- Build settings configured in netlify.toml

## Deployment Process

1. Deploy backend to Render first
2. Note the Render service URL
3. Update frontend configuration with Render URL
4. Deploy frontend to Netlify
5. Configure environment variables in both platforms
6. Test the complete integration

## Environment Variables Required

### Render (Backend)
```
NODE_ENV=production
RAZORPAY_MODE=test  # or 'live'
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID_TEST=your_test_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET_TEST=your_test_secret
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret  # optional
```

### Netlify (Frontend)
```
NODE_VERSION=18
NODE_ENV=production
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://your-render-service.onrender.com
# Firebase and EmailJS variables as needed
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend deploys successfully on Render
- [ ] Frontend builds successfully on Netlify
- [ ] Frontend can communicate with backend
- [ ] Payment processing works end-to-end
- [ ] Webhooks are received (if configured)
- [ ] All environment variables are correctly set

This configuration allows for a production-ready deployment with proper separation of concerns between the static frontend and the dynamic backend.
