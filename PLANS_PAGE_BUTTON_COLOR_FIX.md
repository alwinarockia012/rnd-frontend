# Plans Page Button Color Consistency Fix - Summary

## Issue
The disabled buttons (showing "Booked for this week" or "Booked for a month") were using a different color scheme (gray) compared to the active buttons (orange gradient). This created inconsistency in the UI.

## Solution
Updated the CSS to ensure all buttons use the same consistent orange color scheme (#F15A24).

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified Plans.css

#### Updated:
- Disabled button styles to use the same orange gradient as active buttons
- Maintained black text color for proper contrast
- Added opacity to indicate disabled state
- Kept consistent box shadow styling

#### Key Changes:

1. **Disabled Button Background**:
   ```css
   /* Before */
   background: linear-gradient(135deg, #6c757d 0%, #495057 100%);
   
   /* After */
   background: linear-gradient(135deg, #F15A24 50%, #ff7849 100%);
   ```

2. **Disabled Button Text Color**:
   ```css
   /* Before */
   color: #e9ecef;
   
   /* After */
   color: #000;
   ```

3. **Disabled Button Box Shadow**:
   ```css
   /* Before */
   box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
   
   /* After */
   box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(241, 90, 36, 0.2);
   ```

4. **Added Opacity**:
   ```css
   opacity: 0.8;
   ```

## How It Works

1. All buttons (Free Trial, Pay-Per-Run, Monthly Membership) now use the same orange gradient background
2. Disabled buttons maintain the same color scheme but with reduced opacity to indicate their disabled state
3. Text color remains black for proper contrast against the orange background
4. Box shadows use the same orange tint for visual consistency

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Select and purchase a plan
2. Observe that both payable cards transform to show booking status with the same orange color scheme
3. Verify that the disabled buttons have consistent styling with active buttons
4. Check that the text remains readable with proper contrast

## Files Modified

1. `src/Components/Plans/Plans.css` - Updated button color consistency

This fix ensures that all buttons on the Plans page use the same consistent color scheme, creating a more cohesive and professional appearance.
