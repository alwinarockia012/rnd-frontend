# Booking Reset and Free Trial Fix - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Free Trial Duration Check (src/Components/Plans/Plans.jsx)

Modified the `checkFreeTrialEligibility` function to only consider bookings within the last 7 days instead of all bookings:

- Users with bookings older than 7 days are now eligible for free trial again
- Only users with recent bookings (within last week) are marked as ineligible
- Maintains phone number-based eligibility checking with the same time limit

### 2. Created Reset Scripts

#### Browser Console Script
- File: `RESET_BOOKINGS_AND_FIX_FREE_TRIAL.js`
- Allows admin users to delete all bookings through the browser console
- Includes confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletion
- Clears localStorage booking data for the current user

#### Node.js Script
- File: `scripts/reset-bookings.js`
- Can be run from command line to delete all bookings from Firestore
- Uses batch operations for efficient deletion
- Includes safety confirmation prompt

#### User Data Clearing Script
- File: `scripts/clear-user-data.js`
- Provides function to clear localStorage booking data
- Can be run by users in browser console to refresh their local data

### 3. Added NPM Script

- Added `reset-bookings` script to package.json
- Can be run with `npm run reset-bookings`

### 4. Documentation

- Created `RESET_BOOKINGS_GUIDE.md` with detailed instructions
- Explains how to use all the reset functionality
- Provides testing guidelines
