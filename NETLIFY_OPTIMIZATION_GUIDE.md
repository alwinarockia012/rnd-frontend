# üöÄ Netlify Optimization Guide

This guide provides best practices and optimizations for deploying the Run Development app to Netlify for maximum performance and compatibility.

## üìà Performance Optimizations

### 1. Asset Optimization
Netlify automatically optimizes assets when deployed with the proper configuration:

```toml
[context.production.processing]
  skip_processing = false
  [context.production.processing.css]
    bundle = true
    minify = true
  [context.production.processing.js]
    minify = true
  [context.production.processing.images]
    compress = true
  [context.production.processing.html]
    pretty_urls = true
```

### 2. Caching Strategy
Proper caching headers are configured in `netlify.toml`:

- Static assets: Cached for 1 year (immutable)
- Other assets: Cached for 1 month
- HTML files: No caching (ensures fresh content)

### 3. Build Optimization
The build process is optimized with:
- Source map generation disabled for production
- Minification of CSS and JavaScript
- Image compression

## üîß Netlify Functions Optimization

### 1. Function Endpoint Configuration
API routes are properly configured with redirects in `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200
```

### 2. Contact Form Function
The contact form uses Netlify Functions for serverless email handling:
- Endpoint: `/.netlify/functions/contact`
- Environment variables for EmailJS configuration
- Proper error handling and response formatting

## üîí Security Enhancements

### 1. Content Security Policy
A comprehensive CSP is implemented to allow:
- Firebase authentication services
- Google reCAPTCHA
- Required external resources

### 2. HTTP Security Headers
Essential security headers are configured:
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## üåê SPA Routing Configuration

Proper SPA routing is configured for React Router:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

This ensures all routes are properly handled by the React application.

## üöÄ Deployment Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
Use Netlify's environment variable management:
- NODE_VERSION=18
- GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
- Firebase configuration variables

### 2. Build Settings
Optimized build settings in `netlify.toml`:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `build`
- Functions directory: `netlify/functions`

### 3. Node.js Version
Specify the Node.js version to ensure consistency:
```toml
[context.production.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### 1. Build Logs
Monitor build logs in the Netlify dashboard for:
- Build errors
- Warning messages
- Performance insights

### 2. Function Logs
Check function logs for:
- Execution errors
- Performance issues
- Email delivery status

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Function Not Found
**Problem**: 404 errors when accessing API endpoints
**Solution**: 
- Verify the redirect rule in `netlify.toml`
- Check that functions are in the correct directory
- Ensure function names match the endpoint URLs

#### 2. Asset Loading Issues
**Problem**: CSS or JavaScript files not loading
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for CSP violations
- Verify asset paths in the built application
- Confirm caching headers in `netlify.toml`

#### 3. Routing Issues
**Problem**: Page refresh results in 404 errors
**Solution**:
- Verify the SPA redirect rule in `netlify.toml`
- Check that all routes are properly configured in React Router

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

### 1. Git Integration
- Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
- Enable automatic deployments on push
- Set up branch deployment previews

### 2. Build Hooks
Use build hooks for manual triggering:
- Create a build hook in Netlify dashboard
- Use the webhook URL to trigger builds programmatically

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### 1. Lighthouse Scores
Regularly check Lighthouse scores in Chrome DevTools:
- Performance
- Accessibility
- Best Practices
- SEO

### 2. Netlify Analytics
Use Netlify's built-in analytics for:
- Page views
- Bandwidth usage
- Visitor geography
